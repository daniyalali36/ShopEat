  #Introduction:
The world has entered into an era where people rely on Modern technology more than themselves because it makes their life easy. Modern technology handles their problems with ease and provides such solutions which can help them problems in their lives. A part of that Modern technology is applications used on their smart phones. Every successful brand or a company which provide services to its valuable customers have an application for their customers which help them access their features in daily life or for occasional purposes.
This Project is for people who values time means to say this project will manage your shopping list and remind you every 10 minutes that 5 items remaining to buy so that you will not wander in shopping mall and the main problem starts when people have to wait in waiting area of many restaurants for food and waiting for their food after ordering it. This Mobile App helps you to give your order while you’re on your way to restaurant from home or from shopping mall and let you reserve your seat before, So you can get their get your food without waiting and go back to home in shortest time possible.
We divided our application  in three modules User Application (Android App),Admin Application(Android App) and Admin Panel . 

   #Problem Statement:
Applications were working separately but they didn’t have any problems in them because the users who were using those applications were already satisfied with them. Now to identify problems came to as us a challenge to find the weakness in those applications from which a user was already satisfied. We managed to come up with a few problems which are enlisted below:

The problem we have identified that motivates us to develop this application is:
•	Mostly people don’t know which shopping centers and Restaurants are nearby them.
•	The things they want to buy can be in nearby shopping center but what if they don’t know that shopping center and always go for other faraway shopping centers 
•	The food they want to eat can be nearby them in some restaurant but they don’t know about it .
•	Mostly people does not plan their trips before going out of their house and waste more time than they expect.
•	In rush hours people have to face long waiting time at Restaurants.
•	Usually during shopping people forget some of the things they want to buy.
•	Planning and organizing are a huge part of an individual life without it, he/she may be lost or may up ending wasting time in places they rather not, but who let them manage this?
•	Events are important to us specially when they are for an important person(s) so setting reminders to it is necessary, but why use a separate application just to do so?
